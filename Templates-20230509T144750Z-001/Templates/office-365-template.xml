It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific.

It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by using a MAPI editor to notice the modified rule property values.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)

Ensure that third-party application logs are on-boarded to the enterprise logging system and the logs are regularly reviewed. Audit software deployment logs and look for suspicious or unauthorized activity. A system not typically used to push software to clients that suddenly is used for such a task outside of a known admin function may be suspicious.

All systems: "Audit Logon" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4648.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Enable the UpdateFolderPermissions action for all logon types. The mailbox audit log will forward folder permission modification events to the Unified Audit Log. Create rules to alert on ModifyFolderPermissions operations where the Anonymous or Default user is assigned permissions other than None.

A larger than normal volume of emails sent from an account and similar phishing emails sent from real accounts within a network may be a sign that an account was compromised and attempts to leverage access with modified email permissions is occurring.&lt;br /&gt;['T1598.002']: Monitor for suspicious email activity, such as numerous accounts receiving messages from a single unusual/unknown sender.

Similar events may also occur at the boundary through network IDS, email scanning appliance, etc. The initial detection should be treated as an indication of a potentially more invasive intrusion. The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may continue with an operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link that event to other activity occurring on the network.&lt;br /&gt;</desc>

In single flux cases only IP addresses change for static domain names. In double flux cases, nothing is static. Defenders such as domain registrars and service providers are likely in the best position for detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1565']: Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.&lt;br /&gt;['T1568.002']: Detecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. (Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.
Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA.

It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.&lt;br /&gt;['T1606.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts, when requesting access tokens to services, that failed because of Conditional Access Policies (CAP). Some SAML tokens features, such as the location of a user, may not be as easy to claim.&lt;br /&gt;['T1207']: Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with "GC/") by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.001']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary. Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

Monitor for unusual permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1201']: Monitor for contextual data about an account that may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data, etc. that may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134.005']: Examine data in user's SID-History attributes&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.

              <desc>Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS). Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.(Citation: Cloudflare HTTPflood)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.(Citation: Arbor SSLDoS April 2012)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detection of Endpoint DoS can sometimes be achieved before the effect is sufficient to cause significant impact to the availability of the service, but such response time typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness. Typical network throughput monitoring tools such as netflow, SNMP, and custom scripts can be used to detect sudden increases in circuit utilization.(Citation: Cisco DoSdetectNetflow) Real-time, automated, and qualitative study of the network traffic can identify a sudden surge in one type of protocol can be used to detect an attack as it starts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to network level detections, endpoint logging and instrumentation can be useful for detection. Attacks targeting web applications may generate logs in the web server, application server, and/or database server that can be used to identify the type of attack, possibly before the impact is felt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Externally monitor the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.</desc>

              <desc>Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. [Direct Network Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)s are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Botnets are commonly used to conduct network flooding attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global Internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detection of a network flood can sometimes be achieved before the traffic volume is sufficient to cause impact to the availability of the service, but such response time typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness or services provided by an upstream network service provider. Typical network throughput monitoring tools such as netflow(Citation: Cisco DoSdetectNetflow), SNMP, and custom scripts can be used to detect sudden increases in network or service utilization. Real-time, automated, and qualitative study of the network traffic can identify a sudden surge in one type of protocol can be used to detect a network flood event as it starts. Often, the lead time may be small and the indicator of an event availability of the network or service drops. The analysis tools mentioned can then be used to determine the type of DoS causing the outage and help with remediation.</desc>

              <desc>Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.(Citation: Cloudflare ReflectionDoS May 2017) This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS(Citation: Cloudflare DNSamplficationDoS) and NTP(Citation: Cloudflare NTPamplifciationDoS), though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.(Citation: Cloudflare Memcrashed Feb 2018)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detection of reflection amplification can sometimes be achieved before the traffic volume is sufficient to cause impact to the availability of the service, but such response time typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness or services provided by an upstream network service provider. Typical network throughput monitoring tools such as netflow(Citation: Cisco DoSdetectNetflow), SNMP, and custom scripts can be used to detect sudden increases in network or service utilization. Real-time, automated, and qualitative study of the network traffic can identify a sudden surge in one type of protocol can be used to detect a reflection amplification DoS event as it starts.

There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. (Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.
Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA.

              <desc>Adversaries may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information.

(Citation: Microsoft SharePoint Logging). As information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</desc>

              <desc>Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email-forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim's organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018) Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules) Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2)(Citation: Mac Forwarding Rules)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by using a MAPI editor to notice the modified rule property values.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include `X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded` set to true, `X-MailFwdBy` and `X-Forwarded-To`. The `forwardingSMTPAddress` parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to the specified SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the specified destination mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2) High volumes of emails that bear the `X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded` header (indicating auto-forwarding) without a corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than user-level.</desc>

Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. &lt;br /&gt;['T1499.004']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users.

Monitor for references to uncategorized or known-bad sites. URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can also help detect links leading to known malicious sites.&lt;br /&gt;['T1610']: Configuration management databases (CMDB) and other asset management systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that should not exist on a network.&lt;br /&gt;['T1114']: Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include &lt;code&gt;X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded&lt;/code&gt; set to true, &lt;code&gt;X-MailFwdBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-To&lt;/code&gt;.

Monitor access to Microsoft SharePoint repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.004']: Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). If authentication failures are high, then there may be a brute force attempt to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1491.001']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users. &lt;br /&gt;['T1114.003']: Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by using a MAPI editor to notice the modified rule property values.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)
Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific.

Externally monitor the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.&lt;br /&gt;['T1491']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network. &lt;br /&gt;['T1213.003']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information. Monitor access to code repositories, especially performed by privileged users such as Active Directory Domain or Enterprise Administrators as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access code repositories. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1621']: Monitor application logs for suspicious events including repeated MFA failures that may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised.&lt;br /&gt;['T1072']: Often these third-party applications will have logs of their own that can be collected and correlated with other data from the environment. Ensure that third-party application logs are on-boarded to the enterprise logging system and the logs are regularly reviewed. Audit software deployment logs and look for suspicious or unauthorized activity. A system not typically used to push software to clients that suddenly is used for such a task outside of a known admin function may be suspicious. Monitor account login activity on these applications to detect suspicious/abnormal usage.
Perform application deployment at regular times so that irregular deployment activity stands out.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: 
Azure AD creates several log entries when new devices are enrolled, which can be monitored for unexpected device registrations.(Citation: AADInternals - BPRT) Additionally, joined devices can be viewed via the Azure AD portal.(Citation: Microsoft Manage Device Identities)&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.002']: Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. Consider focusing efforts on detecting other adversary behavior used to acquire credential materials, such as [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) or [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003).&lt;br /&gt;['T1213']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository.

Consider the following event IDs:(Citation: Trimarc Detecting Password Spraying)
Domain Controllers: "Audit Logon" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4625.
Domain Controllers: "Audit Kerberos Authentication Service" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4771.
All systems: "Audit Logon" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4648.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Enable the UpdateFolderPermissions action for all logon types. The mailbox audit log will forward folder permission modification events to the Unified Audit Log. Create rules to alert on ModifyFolderPermissions operations where the Anonymous or Default user is assigned permissions other than None.

A larger than normal volume of emails sent from an account and similar phishing emails sent from real accounts within a network may be a sign that an account was compromised and attempts to leverage access with modified email permissions is occurring.&lt;br /&gt;['T1598.002']: Monitor for suspicious email activity, such as numerous accounts receiving messages from a single unusual/unknown sender.

Watch for access to Confluence repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1204']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.&lt;br /&gt;['T1133']: When authentication is not required to access an exposed remote service, monitor for follow-on activities such as anomalous external use of the exposed API or application.&lt;br /&gt;['T1027.005']: The first detection of a malicious tool may trigger an anti-virus or other security tool alert. Similar events may also occur at the boundary through network IDS, email scanning appliance, etc. The initial detection should be treated as an indication of a potentially more invasive intrusion. The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may continue with an operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link that event to other activity occurring on the network.&lt;br /&gt;</desc>

There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. (Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.
Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA.

The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts.

Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

              <desc>Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place. Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly or verify the receipt of an email (i.e. web bugs/web beacons). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s.(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017) These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls. (Citation: Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Consent Phishing 2021)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can help detect links leading to known malicious sites as well as links redirecting to adversary infrastructure based by upon suspicious OAuth patterns with unusual TLDs.(Citation: Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Consent Phishing 2021). Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because this technique usually involves user interaction on the endpoint, many of the possible detections take place once [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) occurs.</desc>

Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021).(Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monitor whether default accounts have been activated or logged into. These audits should also include checks on any appliances and applications for default credentials or SSH keys, and if any are discovered, they should be updated immediately.</desc>

Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.
Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. &lt;br /&gt;['T1499.004']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users.

Monitor for references to uncategorized or known-bad sites. URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can also help detect links leading to known malicious sites.&lt;br /&gt;['T1610']: Configuration management databases (CMDB) and other asset management systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that should not exist on a network.&lt;br /&gt;['T1114']: Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include &lt;code&gt;X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded&lt;/code&gt; set to true, &lt;code&gt;X-MailFwdBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-To&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;forwardingSMTPAddress&lt;/code&gt; parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions.

SensePost, whose tool [Ruler](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0358) can be used to carry out malicious rules, forms, and Home Page attacks, has released a tool to detect Ruler usage.(Citation: SensePost NotRuler)&lt;br /&gt;['T1213.002']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information. Monitor access to Microsoft SharePoint repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.004']: Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by using a MAPI editor to notice the modified rule property values.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)
Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific.

Monitor access to code repositories, especially performed by privileged users such as Active Directory Domain or Enterprise Administrators as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access code repositories. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1621']: Monitor application logs for suspicious events including repeated MFA failures that may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised.&lt;br /&gt;['T1072']: Often these third-party applications will have logs of their own that can be collected and correlated with other data from the environment. Ensure that third-party application logs are on-boarded to the enterprise logging system and the logs are regularly reviewed. Audit software deployment logs and look for suspicious or unauthorized activity. A system not typically used to push software to clients that suddenly is used for such a task outside of a known admin function may be suspicious. Monitor account login activity on these applications to detect suspicious/abnormal usage.
Perform application deployment at regular times so that irregular deployment activity stands out.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: 
Azure AD creates several log entries when new devices are enrolled, which can be monitored for unexpected device registrations.(Citation: AADInternals - BPRT) Additionally, joined devices can be viewed via the Azure AD portal.(Citation: Microsoft Manage Device Identities)&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.002']: Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. Consider focusing efforts on detecting other adversary behavior used to acquire credential materials, such as [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) or [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003).&lt;br /&gt;['T1213']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository.

Consider the following event IDs:(Citation: Trimarc Detecting Password Spraying)
Domain Controllers: "Audit Logon" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4625.
Domain Controllers: "Audit Kerberos Authentication Service" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4771.
All systems: "Audit Logon" (Success &amp; Failure) for event ID 4648.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Enable the UpdateFolderPermissions action for all logon types. The mailbox audit log will forward folder permission modification events to the Unified Audit Log. Create rules to alert on ModifyFolderPermissions operations where the Anonymous or Default user is assigned permissions other than None.

A larger than normal volume of emails sent from an account and similar phishing emails sent from real accounts within a network may be a sign that an account was compromised and attempts to leverage access with modified email permissions is occurring.&lt;br /&gt;['T1598.002']: Monitor for suspicious email activity, such as numerous accounts receiving messages from a single unusual/unknown sender.

Watch for access to Confluence repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1204']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.&lt;br /&gt;['T1133']: When authentication is not required to access an exposed remote service, monitor for follow-on activities such as anomalous external use of the exposed API or application.&lt;br /&gt;['T1027.005']: The first detection of a malicious tool may trigger an anti-virus or other security tool alert. Similar events may also occur at the boundary through network IDS, email scanning appliance, etc. The initial detection should be treated as an indication of a potentially more invasive intrusion. The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may continue with an operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link that event to other activity occurring on the network.&lt;br /&gt;</desc>

One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.001']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary. Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups. The &lt;code&gt;Get-MsolRole&lt;/code&gt; PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts (Citation: Microsoft Msolrole)(Citation: GitHub Raindance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Azure CLI (AZ CLI) and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups. The command &lt;code&gt;az ad user get-member-groups&lt;/code&gt; will list groups associated to a user account for Azure while the API endpoint &lt;code&gt;GET https://cloudidentity.googleapis.com/v1/groups&lt;/code&gt; lists group resources available to a user for Google.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI)(Citation: Black Hills Red Teaming MS AD Azure, 2018)(Citation: Google Cloud Identity API Documentation)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may attempt to list ACLs for objects to determine the owner and other accounts with access to the object, for example, via the AWS &lt;code&gt;GetBucketAcl&lt;/code&gt; API (Citation: AWS Get Bucket ACL).

The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts.

Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password

It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific.

          <desc>A profile representing a user, device, service, or application used to authenticate and access resources&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed detections per technique:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.002']:  Monitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. (ex: Windows EID 4625 or 5379)&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.002']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by the use of domain authentication services, such as the System Security Services Daemon (sssd) on Linux&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.004']: Monitor the activity of cloud accounts to detect abnormal or malicious behavior, such as accessing information outside of the normal function of the account or account usage at atypical hours.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.007']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1070']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.003']: Audit all Kerberos authentication and credential use events and review for discrepancies. Unusual remote authentication events that correlate with other suspicious activity (such as writing and executing binaries) may indicate malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1621']: Monitor user account logs for suspicious events: unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device receiving 2FA/MFA request prompts, and high volume of repeated login attempts, all of which may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised minus 2FA/MFA mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;['T1212']: Credential resources obtained through exploitation may be detectable in use if they are not normally used or seen.&lt;br /&gt;['T1110']:  Monitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.&lt;br /&gt;['T1606.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts, when requesting access tokens to services, that failed because of Conditional Access Policies (CAP). Some SAML tokens features, such as the location of a user, may not be as easy to claim.&lt;br /&gt;['T1207']: Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with "GC/") by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.001']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary. Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

Monitor for unusual permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1201']: Monitor for contextual data about an account that may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data, etc. that may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134.005']: Examine data in user's SID-History attributes&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.

              <desc>Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Credentials)(Citation: AWS Temporary Security Credentials) The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions for this feature are misconfigured - for example, by allowing all users to request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs Enumerating AWS Roles)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a "refresh" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim's primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monitor access token activity for abnormal use and permissions granted to unusual or suspicious applications and APIs. Additionally, administrators should review logs for calls to the AWS Security Token Service (STS) and usage of GCP service accounts in order to identify anomalous actions.(Citation: AWS Logging IAM Calls)(Citation: GCP Monitoring Service Account Usage)</desc>

SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers. (Citation: Microsoft Trust Considerations Nov 2014) (Citation: Microsoft SID Filtering Quarantining Jan 2009) However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources.

SID Filtering can be applied by: (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012)

* Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (&lt;code&gt;netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:no&lt;/code&gt; on the domain controller)

* Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012) (Citation: AdSecurity Kerberos GT Aug 2015) If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest.

(Citation: Microsoft Trust Considerations Nov 2014) (Citation: Microsoft SID Filtering Quarantining Jan 2009) However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources.

SID Filtering can be applied by: (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012)

* Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:no on the domain controller)

* Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (&lt;code&gt;netdom trust &lt;TrustingDomainName&gt; /domain:&lt;TrustedDomainName&gt; /quarantine:yes&lt;/code&gt; on the domain controller)

* Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012) (Citation: AdSecurity Kerberos GT Aug 2015) If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest.

Because this method may be used in conjunction with  [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001), it may be appropriate to also verify the integrity of the vendor provided operating system image file.

Compare the checksum of the operating system file with the checksum of a known good copy from a trusted source. Some embedded network device platforms may have the capability to calculate the checksum of the file, while others may not. Even for those platforms that have the capability, it is recommended to download a copy of the file to a trusted computer to calculate the checksum with software that is not compromised.

Many vendors of embedded network devices can provide advanced debugging support that will allow them to work with device owners to validate the integrity of the operating system running in memory. If a compromise of the operating system is suspected, contact the vendor technical support and seek such services for a more thorough inspection of the current running system.

          <desc>A profile representing a user, device, service, or application used to authenticate and access resources&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed detections per technique:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.002']:  Monitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. (ex: Windows EID 4625 or 5379)&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.002']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by the use of domain authentication services, such as the System Security Services Daemon (sssd) on Linux&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.004']: Monitor the activity of cloud accounts to detect abnormal or malicious behavior, such as accessing information outside of the normal function of the account or account usage at atypical hours.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.007']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1070']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.003']: Audit all Kerberos authentication and credential use events and review for discrepancies. Unusual remote authentication events that correlate with other suspicious activity (such as writing and executing binaries) may indicate malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1621']: Monitor user account logs for suspicious events: unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device receiving 2FA/MFA request prompts, and high volume of repeated login attempts, all of which may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised minus 2FA/MFA mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;['T1212']: Credential resources obtained through exploitation may be detectable in use if they are not normally used or seen.&lt;br /&gt;['T1110']:  Monitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.&lt;br /&gt;['T1606.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts, when requesting access tokens to services, that failed because of Conditional Access Policies (CAP). Some SAML tokens features, such as the location of a user, may not be as easy to claim.&lt;br /&gt;['T1207']: Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with "GC/") by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.001']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary. Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

Monitor for unusual permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1201']: Monitor for contextual data about an account that may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data, etc. that may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134.005']: Examine data in user's SID-History attributes&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.

Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* SSH (22/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* Telnet (23/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* FTP (21/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP &amp;amp; 445/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* LDAP (389/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* Kerberos (88/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP &amp;amp; 443/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* MSSQL (1433/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* Oracle (1521/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* MySQL (3306/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* VNC (5900/TCP)&lt;br&gt;* SNMP (161/UDP and 162/TCP/UDP)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018). Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such as `wlanAPI`) to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.(Citation: Trend Micro Emotet 2020)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). If authentication failures are high, then there may be a brute force attempt to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.</desc>

Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain.

              <desc>An adversary may forge SAML tokens with any permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Steps) The default lifetime of a SAML token is one hour, but the validity period can be specified in the &lt;code&gt;NotOnOrAfter&lt;/code&gt; value of the &lt;code&gt;conditions ...&lt;/code&gt; element in a token. This value can be changed using the &lt;code&gt;AccessTokenLifetime&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;LifetimeTokenPolicy&lt;/code&gt;.(Citation: Microsoft SAML Token Lifetimes) Forged SAML tokens enable adversaries to authenticate across services that use SAML 2.0 as an SSO (single sign-on) mechanism.(Citation: Cyberark Golden SAML)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An adversary may utilize [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) to compromise an organization's token-signing certificate to create forged SAML tokens. If the adversary has sufficient permissions to establish a new federation trust with their own Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server, they may instead generate their own trusted token-signing certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance) This differs from [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528) and other similar behaviors in that the tokens are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An adversary may gain administrative Azure AD privileges if a SAML token is forged which claims to represent a highly privileged account. This may lead to [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This technique may be difficult to detect as SAML tokens are signed by a trusted certificate. The forging process may not be detectable since it is likely to happen outside of a defender's visibility, but subsequent usage of the forged token may be seen. Monitor for anomalous logins using SAML tokens created by a compromised or adversary generated token-signing certificate. These logins may occur on any on-premises resources as well as from any cloud environment that trusts the certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance) Search for logins to service providers using SAML SSO which do not have corresponding 4769, 1200, and 1202 events in the Domain.(Citation: Sygnia Golden SAML)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consider modifying SAML responses to include custom elements for each service provider.

              <desc>Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens. If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container's token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.(Citation: Kubernetes Service Accounts)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Protocols May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft - OAuth Code Authorization flow - June 2019) An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.(Citation: Amnesty OAuth Phishing Attacks, August 2019)(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017) The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD App Registration - May 2019) Then, they can send a [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application. Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD Identity Tokens - Aug 2019)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token. However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens(Citation: Auth0 Understanding Refresh Tokens), allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.</desc>

              <desc>An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems.

Externally monitor the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.&lt;br /&gt;['T1491']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network. &lt;br /&gt;['T1213.003']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information. Monitor access to code repositories, especially performed by privileged users such as Active Directory Domain or Enterprise Administrators as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access code repositories. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;['T1621']: Monitor application logs for suspicious events including repeated MFA failures that may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised.&lt;br /&gt;['T1072']: Often these third-party applications will have logs of their own that can be collected and correlated with other data from the environment. Ensure that third-party application logs are on-boarded to the enterprise logging system and the logs are regularly reviewed. Audit software deployment logs and look for suspicious or unauthorized activity. A system not typically used to push software to clients that suddenly is used for such a task outside of a known admin function may be suspicious. Monitor account login activity on these applications to detect suspicious/abnormal usage.

Azure AD creates several log entries when new devices are enrolled, which can be monitored for unexpected device registrations.(Citation: AADInternals - BPRT) Additionally, joined devices can be viewed via the Azure AD portal.(Citation: Microsoft Manage Device Identities)&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.002']: Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. Consider focusing efforts on detecting other adversary behavior used to acquire credential materials, such as [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) or [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003).&lt;br /&gt;['T1213']: Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository.

Similar events may also occur at the boundary through network IDS, email scanning appliance, etc. The initial detection should be treated as an indication of a potentially more invasive intrusion. The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may continue with an operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link that event to other activity occurring on the network.&lt;br /&gt;</desc>

          <desc>A profile representing a user, device, service, or application used to authenticate and access resources&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed detections per technique:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;['T1110.002']:  Monitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. (ex: Windows EID 4625 or 5379)&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.002']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by the use of domain authentication services, such as the System Security Services Daemon (sssd) on Linux&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.004']: Monitor the activity of cloud accounts to detect abnormal or malicious behavior, such as accessing information outside of the normal function of the account or account usage at atypical hours.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.007']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1070']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.003']: Audit all Kerberos authentication and credential use events and review for discrepancies. Unusual remote authentication events that correlate with other suspicious activity (such as writing and executing binaries) may indicate malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1621']: Monitor user account logs for suspicious events: unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device receiving 2FA/MFA request prompts, and high volume of repeated login attempts, all of which may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised minus 2FA/MFA mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;['T1212']: Credential resources obtained through exploitation may be detectable in use if they are not normally used or seen.&lt;br /&gt;['T1110']:  Monitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.&lt;br /&gt;['T1606.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts, when requesting access tokens to services, that failed because of Conditional Access Policies (CAP). Some SAML tokens features, such as the location of a user, may not be as easy to claim.&lt;br /&gt;['T1207']: Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with "GC/") by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.001']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary. Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

Monitor for unusual permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1201']: Monitor for contextual data about an account that may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data, etc. that may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1134.005']: Examine data in user's SID-History attributes&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.

              <desc>Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;Add-MailboxPermission&lt;/code&gt; [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft - Add-MailboxPermission)(Citation: FireEye APT35 2018)(Citation: Crowdstrike Hiding in Plain Sight 2018) In Google Workspace, delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console and users can delegate accounts via their Gmail settings.(Citation: Gmail Delegation)(Citation: Google Ensuring Your Information is Safe) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles. In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or other mailbox folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user's mail folders.(Citation: Remediation and Hardening Strategies for Microsoft 365 to Defend Against UNC2452)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003) to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules (ex: [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)), so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.(Citation: Bienstock, D. - Defending O365 - 2019)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enable the UpdateFolderPermissions action for all logon types.

Create rules to alert on ModifyFolderPermissions operations where the Anonymous or Default user is assigned permissions other than None. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A larger than normal volume of emails sent from an account and similar phishing emails sent from real accounts within a network may be a sign that an account was compromised and attempts to leverage access with modified email permissions is occurring.</desc>

              <desc>Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles. The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts. (Citation: Microsoft Change Normal Template)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros (Citation: MSDN VBA in Office) can be inserted into the base template and used to execute code when the respective Office application starts in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded.(Citation: enigma0x3 normal.dotm)(Citation: Hexacorn Office Template Macros) Shared templates may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.(Citation: GlobalDotName Jun 2019) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Word Normal.dotm location:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excel Personal.xlsb location:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by hijacking the application's search order, e.g. Word 2016 will first look for Normal.dotm under &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\&lt;/code&gt;, or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key. By modifying the GlobalDotName registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application startup. To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may first need to register the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location.(Citation: GlobalDotName Jun 2019) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many Office-related persistence mechanisms require changes to the Registry and for binaries, files, or scripts to be written to disk or existing files modified to include malicious scripts. Collect events related to Registry key creation and modification for keys that could be used for Office-based persistence.(Citation: CrowdStrike Outlook Forms)(Citation: Outlook Today Home Page) Modification to base templates, like Normal.dotm, should also be investigated since the base templates should likely not contain VBA macros. Changes to the Office macro security settings should also be investigated.(Citation: GlobalDotName Jun 2019)</desc>

Malicious rules will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.(Citation: SilentBreak Outlook Rules)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft has released a PowerShell script to safely gather mail forwarding rules and custom forms in your mail environment as well as steps to interpret the output.(Citation: Microsoft Detect Outlook Forms) This PowerShell script is ineffective in gathering rules with modified `PRPR_RULE_MSG_NAME` and `PR_RULE_MSG_PROVIDER` properties caused by adversaries using a Microsoft Exchange Server Messaging API Editor (MAPI Editor), so only examination with the Exchange Administration tool MFCMapi can reveal these mail forwarding rules.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules) SensePost, whose tool [Ruler](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0358) can be used to carry out malicious rules, forms, and Home Page attacks, has released a tool to detect Ruler usage.(Citation: SensePost NotRuler)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collect process execution information including process IDs (PID) and parent process IDs (PPID) and look for abnormal chains of activity resulting from Office processes. Non-standard process execution trees may also indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.</desc>

In single flux cases only IP addresses change for static domain names. In double flux cases, nothing is static. Defenders such as domain registrars and service providers are likely in the best position for detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1565']: Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.&lt;br /&gt;['T1568.002']: Detecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. (Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.
Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA. (Citation: Pace University Detecting DGA May 2017) Another approach is to use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated(Citation: Elastic Predicting DGA)]&lt;br /&gt;['T1612']: Monitor for established network communications with anomalous IPs that have never been seen before in the environment that may indicate the download of malicious code.&lt;br /&gt;['T1557.003']: Monitor network traffic for anomalies associated with known AiTM behavior.

Some SAML tokens features, such as the location of a user, may not be as easy to claim.&lt;br /&gt;['T1207']: Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with "GC/") by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.(Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.&lt;br /&gt;['T1552.005']: It may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained such as in [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).&lt;br /&gt;['T1078.001']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials&lt;br /&gt;['T1550.002']: Monitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.&lt;br /&gt;['T1070.005']: Monitoring for Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.&lt;br /&gt;['T1078']: Monitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. &lt;br /&gt;['T1070.003']: Monitor for an attempts by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials via remote terminal services, that do not have a corresponding entry in a command history file.&lt;br /&gt;['T1550']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.&lt;br /&gt;['T1538']: Correlate other security systems with login information&lt;br /&gt;['T1552']: Monitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.&lt;br /&gt;['T1564.002']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts, such as userIDs under 500 on macOS, that may mask the presence of user accounts they create or modify.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.003']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through the collection of usage logs from cloud user and administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the creation of new accounts and assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1136.001']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary. Collect data on account creation within a network or Windows Event ID 4720 (for when a user account is created on a Windows system and domain controller).&lt;br /&gt;['T1564']: Monitor for newly constructed user accounts that may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (ex: Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.001']: Monitor Azure Activity Logs for Service Principal and Application modifications. Monitor for the usage of APIs that create or import SSH keys, particularly by unexpected users or accounts such as the root account.&lt;br /&gt;['T1528']: Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a "High severity app permissions" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.
Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app's purpose, or apps with old "Last authorized" fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.
Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.&lt;br /&gt;['T1531']: Monitor for changes made to user accounts for unexpected modification of properties, such as passwords or status (enabled/disabled). Windows event logs may designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:
Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
Event ID 4725 - A user account was disabled

Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.003']: Collect usage logs from cloud administrator accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles that go over a certain threshold of known admins.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098.005']: Monitor user accounts for new and suspicious device associations, such as those originating from unusual sources, occurring at unusual times, or following a suspicious login.(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537) &lt;br /&gt;['T1098.002']: Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.&lt;br /&gt;['T1098']: Monitor events for changes to account objects and/or permissions on systems and the domain, such as event IDs 4738, 4728 and 4670. Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.

Adversaries attempt to take advantage of a trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking the target into falling for the phish attempt.(Citation: Trend Micro When Phishing Starts from the Inside 2017)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may leverage [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001) or [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056) on sites that mimic email login interfaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been notable incidents where internal spearphishing has been used. The Eye Pyramid campaign used phishing emails with malicious attachments for lateral movement between victims, compromising nearly 18,000 email accounts in the process.(Citation: Trend Micro When Phishing Starts from the Inside 2017) The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) compromised email accounts at the Financial Times (FT) to steal additional account credentials. Once FT learned of the campaign and began warning employees of the threat, the SEA sent phishing emails mimicking the Financial Times IT department and were able to compromise even more users.(Citation: THE FINANCIAL TIMES LTD 2019.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways usually do not scan internal email, but an organization can leverage the journaling-based solution which sends a copy of emails to a security service for offline analysis or incorporate service-integrated solutions using on-premise or API-based integrations to help detect internal spearphishing campaigns.(Citation: Trend Micro When Phishing Starts from the Inside 2017)</desc>

              <desc>&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses [Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009) of directory .LNK files that use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to look like the real directories, which are hidden through [Hidden Files and Directories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001). The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts. (Citation: Retwin Directory Share Pivot)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Processes that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious. Monitor processes that are executed from removable media for malicious or abnormal activity such as network connections due to Command and Control and possible network Discovery techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frequently scan shared network directories for malicious files, hidden files, .LNK files, and other file types that may not typical exist in directories used to share specific types of content.</desc>

              <desc>Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Credentials)(Citation: AWS Temporary Security Credentials) The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions for this feature are misconfigured - for example, by allowing all users to request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs Enumerating AWS Roles)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a "refresh" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim's primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monitor access token activity for abnormal use and permissions granted to unusual or suspicious applications and APIs. Additionally, administrators should review logs for calls to the AWS Security Token Service (STS) and usage of GCP service accounts in order to identify anomalous actions.(Citation: AWS Logging IAM Calls)(Citation: GCP Monitoring Service Account Usage)</desc>

              <desc>Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently.

After the cookie is obtained through [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539) or [Web Cookies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/001), the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active.
